# Introduction
---

This repository is a collection of responses to practice coding interview questions and other various experiments written in Python.

Responses with input and output files get their own subdirectory and so do
implementations of datasructures and algorithms.

# Running Tests
---

This project uses Python's built-in unittest test runner.

Run "python -m unittest discover -s tests" in the python_practice directory to 
run all tests.

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
